Trojan Description
	After detecting a specific input plaintext, the Trojan leaks the secret key of AES-128 through the leakage current. 
	The leakage circuit (LC) consists of a shift register holding the secret key and two inverters. The least significant 
	bit of the shift register is connected to one inverter whose output connected to the input of the other inverter. 
	Whenever the least significant bit is '0', a direct path between power and ground composed by the PMOS of the first 
	inverter and the NMOS of the second inverter is created for a limited time. Therefore, the secret key can be retrieved 
	by measuring the leakage current.
