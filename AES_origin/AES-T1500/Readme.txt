Trojan Description
	After each 128'hFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF encryptions, the Trojan demonstrates an attack on the AES-128 
	block-cipher and its corresponding key schedule. The idea is to artificially introduce leaking intermediate 
	states in the key schedule that depend on known input bits and key bits, but that naturally would not 
	occur during regular processing of the cipher. The Trojan uses AND conjunctions to pairwise combine each 
	key bit with another input bit. The output of the AND gates are then combined to the leaked intermediate 
	value by XORing all of them. The Trojan leaks one byte of the AES round key for each round of the key schedule. 
	The leakage circuit (LC) is a 16-bit shift register and loaded it with an initial alternating sequence 
	of zeros and ones. The shift register is only enabled in case the input to the leakage circuit is one, 
	which results in an additional dynamic power consumption [1].
