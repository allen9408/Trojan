Trojan Description
	Whenever a predefined input plaintext is observed, the Trojan leaks the secret key from a cryptographic chip running 
	the AES algorithm through a covert channel. The channel adapts the concepts from spread spectrum communications 
	(also known as Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA)) to distribute the leakage of single bits over many clock cycles. 
	The Trojan employs this method by using a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to create a CDMA code sequence, 
	the PRNG initialized to a predefined value. The code sequence is then used to XOR modulate the secret information bits. 
	The modulated sequence is forwarded to a leakage circuit (LC) to set up a covert CDMA channel in the power side-channel. 
	The LC is realized by connecting eight identical flip-flop elements to the single output of the XOR gate to mimic 
	a large capacitance [1].
