Trojan Description
	Modulating an (unused) pin on a chip generates an RF signal. This signal can be used to transmit the key bits. 
	This attack is performed at 1560 KHz and can be received with an ordinary AM radio. The data carried by 
	the AM signal needs to be easily interpreted by a human. A beep scheme is utilized where a single beep followed 
	by a pause represents a ‘0’ and a double beep followed by a pause represents a ‘1’. A description on detail 
	implementation of AM transmission can be found at [1]. In this implementation, the Trojan gets activated when a
	predefined input plaintext is observed. 


Trojan Taxonomy
	Insertion phase: Design
	Abstraction level: Register Transfer level  
	Activation mechanism: Internally conditionally triggered
	Effects: Leak Information
 	Location: Processor
	Physical characteristics: Functional
